## Translate your app is so fast! 🚀

You will be able to translate easily

### How to translate ?

Anywhere in your app, call the `t()` function like this exemple :

    t({
        id:"my-profil",
        variables: {
            name: "Billy",
            age: 25,
            job: "software egineer"
        },
        language: "en"
    })

You will get this outpout :

`Hello, My name is John, I am 25 and I am software egineer.`
